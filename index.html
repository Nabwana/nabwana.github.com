                      around where I live I skimmed through it and when I found out that it is a programming school I did not think twice as I was always intrigued
                      about coding but <span> <strong>ever was able to get an effective</strong> </span>way to self teach myself so I did not hesitate inquiring and getting ready to embark on this
